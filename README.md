## HVAC Full Stack prototype

### General
This project is a working prototype for a home thermostat that stores heat and A/C usage to a MYSQL database and publishes it to a browser-based dashboard.

#### Thermostat Prototype
The thermostat prototype software is designed to run on the Texas Instruments SimpleLink Wireless MCU (CC3220S-LAUNCHXL). 

#### MYSQL Scripts
Data management is handled using PHP scripts on both server and client side.

#### The Website
The dasboard is a collection of graphs creating using Canvas.js. Different metrics are displayed using the same underlying date (HVAC usage).
